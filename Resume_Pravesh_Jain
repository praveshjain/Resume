\section*{Experience}

    \subsection*{Software Engineer, Impetus Infotech Pvt. Ltd., July 2013 - Present}
    Working with iLabs. Focus on R \& D work on emerging technologies in Big Data.
    Languages - Java, Scala
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Implementing Image and Text analysis algorithms using Deep Neural Networks on Apache Spark.
            \begin{itemize}
            \item Implementing a library for using Neural Networks over Apache Spark.
            \item Implementing an algorithm for Image classification over the Neural Network library on Apache Spark.
            \item Implementing an algorithm for Sentiment Analysis over the Neural Network library on Apache Spark.
            \end{itemize}
        \item Comparing Spark SQL against Esper on Storm in Java. Confirmed that Spark SQL is equipped to perform all the functionalities available with Esper on Storm. This task resulted in change of platform for StreamAnalytix, one of the major products of Impetus.
    	\item Implemented algorithms using reinforcement learning on Apache Spark in Scala. This work resulted in a talk at the Spark Summit.
    	\item Benchmarking Apache Hive against competing technologies such as Presto, BlinkDB and Spark-Streaming against Storm.
    \end{itemize}
